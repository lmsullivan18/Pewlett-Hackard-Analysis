# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to help prepare the HR department at Pewlett Hackard by sharing more insights into the number of employees at the company who are predicted to retire soon. We also pulled together a list of employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results

The main takeaways from this analysis are the following:

- The titles with the largest number of employees who are likely retiring soon are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff. Between those two titles, there are nearly 60,000 employees close to retiring.

- There are about 1,500 employees who are of retirement age who, based on birth date, would be a good fit for a mentorship program at the company.

- The title with the least number of people who are at risk of retiring, by far, is the Manager position. Only two people are nearing retirement with that title. Other titles with less people at risk of retirement include Assistant Engineer and Technique Leader.

## Summary

As the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact, over 90,000 roles will likely need to be filled. While we did an analysis of the titles that need to be filled, I would recommend doing a deeper dive into roles by department that need to be filled, so that outreach efforts can begin to prepare the employee pipeline.

There are about 1,500 qualified, retirement-ready employees at the company to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. Given the size of the company, this may not be enough people for a mentorship program!
